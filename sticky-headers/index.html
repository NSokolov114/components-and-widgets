          Three dark dust lanes give the picturesque Trifid Nebula its name. The
          red and blue colors of the Trifid Nebula are present in different
          regions and are created by different processes. A big bright star near
          the center of the red region appears white hot and emits light so
          energetic it knocks electrons away from gas surrounding it. When an
          electron is recaptured by a proton, red light is frequently emitted.
          The blue region is centered on another bright star but this region's
          dust reflects light to us. The two regions are thus called an emission
          nebula and reflection nebula, respectively. The Trifid Nebula can be
          seen in Sagittarius toward the Galactic Center with a small telescope.
