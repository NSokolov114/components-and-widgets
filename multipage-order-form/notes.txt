Create two-part (multi-step) order form:

First page collects basic customer information
Second page that allows users to specify their service preferences  
Note: Task for JS Managing State Information and Security

Submitting data from multiple forms using *hidden fields*:

Page 1: form part 1
	Field values are encoded in query string, 
	then copied to hidden fields on the next page
Page 2: form part 2
	ALL field values are encoded in query 
	string, then submitted to server
Page 3: submitted data


Bonus points:
outside the form: - button to fill the form with rnd data from rnduserapi
			- button to reset everything and go to the page 1
maybe implement the same functionality with a tabbed component ?
