Ideas for projects (or projects as a whole) are taken from numerous courses, guildes, tutorials or my imagination. I want to mention 2 great courses on Udemy that I highly recommend for all beginning web developers:  
- [50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/) by Brad Traversy  
- [JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/) by Jacinto Wong and ZTM.
